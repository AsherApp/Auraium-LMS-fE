# Assignment End-to-End Flow Documentation

## üìã **Overview**
This document outlines the complete assignment workflow from teacher creation to student submission, grading, and feedback. This serves as the definitive reference for the assignment system implementation.

## üîÑ **Assignment Status Flow**

### **Status Definitions:**
1. **`not_started`** - Student hasn't submitted anything yet
2. **`submitted`** - Student has submitted their work
3. **`graded`** - Teacher has graded the submission (final)
4. **`returned`** - Teacher has returned it for resubmission (with feedback)
5. **`awaiting_response`** - Student needs to resubmit after teacher requested changes

### **Status Flow Diagram:**
```
not_started ‚Üí submitted ‚Üí graded
                    ‚Üì
                returned ‚Üí awaiting_response ‚Üí submitted (again)
```

### **Status Mapping (Backend ‚Üí Frontend):**
- `returned` (database) ‚Üí `awaiting_response` (frontend display)
- `submitted` (database) ‚Üí `submitted` (frontend display)
- `graded` (database) ‚Üí `graded` (frontend display)
- No submission ‚Üí `not_started` (frontend display)

## üóÑÔ∏è **Database Schema**

### **Assignments Table**

CREATE TABLE assignments (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  title VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  course_id UUID REFERENCES courses(id),
  module_id UUID REFERENCES modules(id),
  lesson_id UUID REFERENCES lessons(id),
  type VARCHAR NOT NULL, -- essay, quiz, project, etc.
  points INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  due_at TIMESTAMP,
  available_from TIMESTAMP,
  available_until TIMESTAMP,
  is_published BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  settings JSONB, -- type-specific settings (quiz questions, etc.)
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

CREATE TYPE submission_status AS ENUM (
  'submitted',
  'graded', 
  'returned'
);
```

- `useSubmission(id)` - Hook for single submission data

### **API Services**
- `StudentAssignmentsAPI` - Clean API for student assignment operations
- `TeacherSubmissionsAPI` - Clean API for teacher submission operations

## üîê **Access Control**

### **Teacher Permissions**
- Create, edit, delete assignments in their courses
- View all submissions for their assignments
- Grade submissions and provide feedback
- Request resubmissions

### **Student Permissions**
- View assignments in enrolled courses
- Submit assignments (before due date)
- View their own grades and feedback
- Resubmit if requested by teacher

## üìä **Status Computed Fields**

### **Backend Computation (for students)**
```typescript
const assignmentWithComputedFields = {
  ...assignment,
  is_submitted: !!studentSubmission,
  is_graded: studentSubmission?.status === 'graded',
  status: studentSubmission ? 
    (studentSubmission.status === 'returned' ? 'awaiting_response' : 
     studentSubmission.status === 'graded' ? 'graded' : 
     studentSubmission.status === 'submitted' ? 'submitted' : 'not_started') : 
    'not_started',
  can_resubmit: studentSubmission?.status === 'returned',
  student_submission: studentSubmission
}
```

### **Frontend Status Display**
- **Not Started**: Gray badge, "Start Assignment" button
- **Submitted**: Blue badge, "View Submission" button
- **Graded**: Green badge, "View Result" button
- **Awaiting Response**: Orange badge, "Resubmit" button

## üö® **Error Handling**

### **Common Error Scenarios**
1. **Student not enrolled**: 403 Forbidden
2. **Assignment not found**: 404 Not Found
3. **Invalid submission content**: 400 Bad Request
4. **Unauthorized grading**: 403 Forbidden
5. **Assignment overdue**: 400 Bad Request (if late submissions disabled)

### **Validation Rules**
- Assignment content must match assignment type
- File uploads must meet size/type requirements
- Quiz answers must be valid for quiz questions
- Grades must be within 0 to assignment points range

## üîÑ **Resubmission Logic**

### **When Resubmission is Allowed**
- Teacher sets `requestResubmission: true` during grading
- Student status becomes `awaiting_response`
- Student can submit new content
- Attempt number increments

### **When Resubmission is Not Allowed**
- Teacher sets `requestResubmission: false` during grading
- Student status becomes `graded`
- Assignment is marked as complete
- No further submissions allowed

## üì± **Mobile Responsiveness**

### **Key Considerations**
- Touch-friendly submission forms
- Responsive file upload areas
- Mobile-optimized grading interface
- Swipe gestures for navigation

## üîç **Testing Scenarios**

### **End-to-End Test Cases**
1. **Complete Flow**: Create ‚Üí Submit ‚Üí Grade ‚Üí Complete
2. **Resubmission Flow**: Create ‚Üí Submit ‚Üí Return ‚Üí Resubmit ‚Üí Grade
3. **Multiple Attempts**: Multiple resubmissions with feedback
4. **Different Types**: Test all assignment types
5. **Access Control**: Verify permissions for teachers/students
6. **Error Handling**: Test invalid submissions, unauthorized access

### **Performance Considerations**
- Lazy loading of assignment content
- Efficient submission queries
- Optimized file upload handling
- Caching of assignment metadata

## üìù **Implementation Notes**

### **Key Files (Current Working Implementation)**
- **Backend**: `Endubackend/src/routes/assignments/index.ts` - Assignment endpoints with computed status
- **Backend**: `Endubackend/src/routes/submissions/index.ts` - Submission management
- **Student API**: `services/student-assignments/api.ts` - Clean student assignment API
- **Student Hooks**: `hooks/use-student-assignments.ts` - Student assignment hooks
- **Teacher API**: `services/teacher-submissions/api.ts` - Clean teacher submission API
- **Teacher Hooks**: `hooks/use-teacher-submissions.ts` - Teacher submission hooks
- **Student Pages**: `app/(lms)/student/assignments/page.tsx` - Student assignments list
- **Student Detail**: `app/(lms)/student/assignment/[id]/page.tsx` - Student assignment detail
- **Teacher Detail**: `app/(lms)/teacher/assignment/[aid]/submission/[studentEmail]/page.tsx` - Teacher grading

### **Status Consistency**
- Backend computes status: `returned` ‚Üí `awaiting_response`, `submitted` ‚Üí `submitted`, `graded` ‚Üí `graded`
- Frontend uses computed status from backend API responses
- Status badges and UI elements use consistent color coding
- No raw database status used in frontend

### **Data Flow**
1. **Student Flow**: `useStudentAssignments()` ‚Üí `StudentAssignmentsAPI.getStudentAssignments()` ‚Üí `/api/assignments`
2. **Teacher Flow**: `useAssignmentSubmissions(id)` ‚Üí `TeacherSubmissionsAPI.getAssignmentSubmissions()` ‚Üí `/api/submissions/assignment/[id]`
3. **Grading Flow**: `TeacherSubmissionsAPI.gradeSubmission()` ‚Üí `/api/submissions/[id]/grade`
4. **Submission Flow**: `StudentAssignmentsAPI.submitAssignment()` ‚Üí `/api/submissions`

### **Clean Architecture**
- **Separation of Concerns**: Student and teacher APIs are separate
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript types throughout
- **Error Handling**: Proper error states and user feedback
- **Loading States**: Consistent loading indicators
- **No Debug Code**: Production-ready, no console.logs or debug displays

This documentation serves as the definitive reference for the assignment system. The implementation is now clean, maintainable, and production-ready.
