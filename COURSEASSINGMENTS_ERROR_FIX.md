# 🔧 courseAssignments Error Fix

## ✅ **ERROR RESOLVED**

Fixed the `Uncaught Error: courseAssignments is not defined` in the teacher course detail page.

---

## 🐛 **Issue Description**

**Error**: `courseAssignments is not defined at TeacherCourseDetailPage (page.tsx:830:110)`

**Location**: `/app/(lms)/teacher/course/[id]/page.tsx` line 830

**Cause**: The FluidTabs component was referencing `courseAssignments` variable that didn't exist in the component scope.

---

## 🔧 **Fix Applied**

### **1. Variable Name Correction**
```tsx
// BEFORE (Line 830) - ERROR
{ id: 'assignments', label: 'Assignments', icon: <ClipboardList className="h-4 w-4" />, badge: courseAssignments?.length || 0 }

// AFTER - FIXED
{ id: 'assignments', label: 'Assignments', icon: <ClipboardList className="h-4 w-4" />, badge: assignments?.length || 0 }
```

### **2. Property Access Fix**
```tsx
// BEFORE (Line 829) - TYPE ERROR
{ id: 'students', label: 'Students', icon: <Users className="h-4 w-4" />, badge: rosterSvc.enrollments?.length || 0 }

// AFTER - FIXED
{ id: 'students', label: 'Students', icon: <Users className="h-4 w-4" />, badge: rosterSvc.items?.length || 0 }
```

## ✅ **Root Cause Analysis**

### **Existing Variables**
The component already had these correctly defined variables:
- ✅ `assignments` (line 78): `const assignments = assignSvc.items || []`
- ✅ `rosterSvc.items` (from useEnrollmentsFn hook)

### **Error Source**
- ❌ FluidTabs was referencing undefined `courseAssignments`
- ❌ Badge count was using non-existent `rosterSvc.enrollments`
