# ðŸŽ“ Student Management System Improvements

## ðŸŽ¯ **Problem Solved**
**Issue:** Student management table showed duplicate entries for students enrolled in multiple courses (e.g., Alice Johnson appeared 4 times for different courses).

**Solution:** Restructured the system to show each student once with consolidated metrics, and detailed course-specific information available on demand.

  - Tracks total, active, and completed courses
  - Provides latest activity across all courses
  - Includes course list for quick reference

#### **New Course Details Endpoint (`/api/students/:email/course/:courseId/details`)**
